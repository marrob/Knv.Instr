        <h1><a name="requirements">Installing the NI-DCPower .NET Class Library</a></h1>


        <p>To use NI-DCPower .NET class library support, your computer must have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          

          <li>
            Microsoft operating system:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Windows 10
              </li>

              <li>
                Windows Server 2019<sup>1</sup>
              </li>
              <li>
                Windows Server 2016
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or later </li>
        </ul>





        <p>
          <sup>1</sup>NI software installs VC2015 Runtime and .NET 4.6.2.
        </p>
        






        <h3>Installation Notes</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You must install the NI-DCPower 21.3 (minimum) instrument driver in order to use the NI-DCPower .NET Class Library. Refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com/drivers/">NI Drivers and Updates</a>
        on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com">ni.com</a> and enter <code>DCPower</code> into
        the search field to download the latest version of the  NI-DCPower instrument driver.

          </li>
          
          <li>
            If Windows Update is enabled, the installation process might hang if Windows Update interferes with the installation of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Run-Time. Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com/info">ni.com/info</a>  and enter the Info Code <code>exjq43</code> for more information  and steps to resolve this issue.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            This product supports, and was tested with, the latest Visual Studio service
            pack and the latest operating system service pack that was available at the time this product was released. NI
            strongly recommends using NI-DCPower with the latest Visual Studio service pack and the latest operating system service pack.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you want to upgrade your operating system from one major version to another, NI
            recommends first uninstalling all NI software, including application software and drivers.
            This is typically not necessary when installing an operating system service pack.
          </li>


        </ul>

        <p>
          The following are known issues in NI-DCPower .NET Class Library 21.3.  For a list of known issues in the underlying driver, refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ni.com/r/dcpower20.6ki">NI-DCPower  Known Issues</a>.
        </p>

        <ul>

          
          <li>
            The NI-DCPower examples may produce a warning - "Warning: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly".
            You can safely ignore this warning.

          </li>

          <li>
            When the NI-DCPower .NET class library is installed, some assemblies specific to previous versions  of NI-DCPower could be deleted from the GAC. The affected assemblies are <span class="code">NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDCPower.dll</span>, <span class="code">NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.Common.dll</span>, and <span class="code">NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.ModularInstrumentsSystem.dll</span>. Any application which refers to specific versions of these assemblies will not compile once later version of the NI-DCPower .NET class library is installed.

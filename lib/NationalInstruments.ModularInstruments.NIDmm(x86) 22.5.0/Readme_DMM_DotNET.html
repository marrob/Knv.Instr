            <h3>Installation Notes</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                You must install the NI-DMM 20.1 (minimum) instrument driver in order to use the .NET API for NI-DMM.
                
              </li>
              <li>
                Support for Windows 32-bit operating systems may require disabling physical address extension (PAE). To learn how this might affect your system and what actions you might need to take, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com/info">ni.com/info</a>  and enter the Info Code <code>PAESupport</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                If Windows Update is enabled, the installation process might hang if Windows Update interferes with the installation of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Run-Time. Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com/info">ni.com/info</a>  and enter the Info Code <code>exjq43</code> for more information and steps to resolve this issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 2016, NI
                dropped support for Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and installations of Windows 7 without any service packs. The NI-DMM .NET Class Library
                will not install or run on an unsupported OS. You cannot deploy or distribute applications that use the NI-DMM .NET Class Library
                to an unsupported OS. Additionally, after installing the NI-DMM .NET Class Library, you cannot use any installers built on this computer with any version of LabVIEW, LabWindows™/CVI™, NI TestStand™, or Measurement Studio on an unsupported OS.
                <p>
                  For more information about the changes to our OS support for 2016, refer to KB 79UC78LS, <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/F73E807066D3309086257FC40063DD50?OpenDocument">Why Does my LabVIEW, LabWindows/CVI, Measurement Studio, or TestStand Built Installer Fail on Windows XP/Vista and Server 2003?</a>.

              </li>
              <li>
                This product supports, and was tested with, the latest Visual Studio service
                pack and the latest operating system service pack that was available at the time this product was released. National Instruments
                strongly recommends using NI-DMM with the latest Visual Studio service pack and the latest operating system service pack.
              </li>

              <li>
                If you want to upgrade your operating system from one major version to another, National Instruments
                recommends first uninstalling all National Instruments software, including application software and drivers.
                This is typically not necessary when installing an operating system service pack.

                In order to be compliant with the  IVI-2014 specifications, the name of the NI-DMM .NET assembly has been changed from <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.dll</code>   to <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.Fx40.dll</code> or <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.Fx45.dll</code>. To ensure you are using the most recent version of the assembly, you must remove the reference to <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.dll</code>, add a reference to <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.Fx40.dll</code> or <code>NationalInstruments.ModularInstruments.NIDmm.Fx45.dll</code>, and rebuild your project.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                The <code>SampleTriggerSlope</code> property of the NI-DMM .NET API is not compatible with the 15.1 version of the underlying attribute in the C driver. You cannot use this property  in any version of the NI-DMM .NET API with NI-DMM 15.1, because the underlying attribute value is different in NI-DMM 15.1. The value of the <code>NIDMM_ATTR_SAMPLE_TRIGGER_SLOPE</code> attribute expected by the <code>SampleTriggerSlope</code> property in the NI-DMM .NET API is 1150010, but the value of <code>NIDMM_ATTR_SAMPLE_TRIGGER_SLOPE</code> in version 15.1 of the NI-DMM C driver is 1150139.   To access the correct sample trigger slope attribute in NI-DMM 15.1, you must use the <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/websearch/8F5A755980210BB586257E89007DCBAC?OpenDocument">AdvancedPropertyAccessService</a>  with the 15.1 value for <code>NIDMM_ATTR_SAMPLE_TRIGGER_SLOPE</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The type for <code>DmmTrigger.Delay</code> has been changed from <code>System.TimeSpan</code> to <code>NationalInstruments.PrecisionTimeSpan</code> to match the type used in the <code>DmmTrigger.Configure</code> method that sets the trigger delay.

		<p>
                	The following are known issues in NI-DMM .NET Class Library 20.1.  For a list of known issues in the underlying driver, refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.ni.com/express.nsf/bycode/dmm20.1ki">NI-DMM 20.1 Known Issues</a>.
    </p>

		<ul>
      <li>
        An installer created on a 32-bit system using the NI-DMM 20.1 .NET API does not install on a 64-bit system. No error is produced during installation; however, the files for your application will not be present on the target machine after installation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking a link from the  <i>NI-DMM .NET Class Library Help</i> to the <i>
          NI Digital Multimeters Help</i> or the <i>NI-DMM Function Reference Help</i> could cause the Microsoft Help Viewer application to stop working.

        <p>
          To work around this issue, install the NI-DMM 20.1 (minimum) instrument driver.  Refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com/drivers/">NI Drivers and Updates</a>
          on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ni.com">ni.com</a> and enter <code>DMM</code> into
          the search field to download the latest version of the  NI-DMM instrument driver.
        </p>
      </li>
      
			<li>
				The NI-DMM examples may produce a warning - "Warning: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly".
				You can safely ignore this warning. This has been explained in following
